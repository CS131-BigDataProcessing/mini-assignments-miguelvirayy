For this script, I decided to perform the basic tasks mentioned in the assignment. I began by removing trailing spaces and the tab spaces between the fields. For the missing values, I decided to replace the them with N/A, as I felt that it was valuable to show which observations had missing data as it would indicate signs of inaccurate data collection for that row. As far as outliers, I felt that the only qualifying field was the price field. I used the data from this field to calculat the mean and IQR. Using the IQR outlier rule, I calculated an upper bound and filtered the data for all rows within this bound. I also filtered the data for price values that were not zero, as the lower bound was negative. The final csv file contains formatted rows with no duplicates or outliers.
