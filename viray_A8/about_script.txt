For this script, I decided to perform the basic tasks mentioned in the assignment. I began by removing trailing spaces and the tab spaces between the fields. For the missing values, Idecided to replace the them with N/A, as I felt that it was valuable to show which observations had missing data as it would indicate signs of inaccurate data collection for the rest of that row, which would be masked if replaced by the mode. Therefore, I calculated the mode and use this to replace the missing files in a separate file, so that they remain separated.
